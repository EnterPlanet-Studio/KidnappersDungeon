# Background:
You were abducted by an unknown kidnapper and imprisoned you in his "basement". And now you have to escape from prison.

# AHTUNG!!!
There may be bugs in the game that I didn't find.

The Win32 and Win64 versions have not been tested (I am a linuxoid).

The steps have a crookedly generated collider. To climb them, you need to jump.
